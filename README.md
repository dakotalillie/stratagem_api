# Stratagem API

## Setup

This app is configured to work with PostgreSQL. To get started with it, you'll
need to add a new file at stratagem_api/config.py, and create a new dictionary
in that file called DATABASE_CONFIG. You can then fill this dictionary up with
the appropriate settings for your installation of PostgreSQL. A good tutorial
for this process can be found [here](https://tutorial-extensions.djangogirls.org/en/optional_postgresql_installation/).
